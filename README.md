### Progress Details
* File upload functionality in Angular.‚úÖ
* Processing uploaded file using Redis Queue in NestJS.‚úÖ
* Write processed file deatils to PostgreSQL database.‚úÖ
* Setup Postgraphile(GraphQL + PostgreSQL) Server pointing to our database.‚úÖ
* Use Apollo Client in Angular to perform Read, Update and Delete functionalities.‚úÖ
* Pagination and Searching Records.‚úÖ
* Web Socket implementation and Docker deployment.(currently working on....)üìùüë®‚Äçüíª

### Deployment Steps
* Enter your PostgreSQL **username** and **password** inside **vehicle-management-backend/src/ormconfig.ts** file and create a **database** called **vehicle_db**.

* Redis must be active and running on **127.0.0.1:6379** (localhost port 6379).

* Then go inside the **vehicle-management-backend folder** and run following commands;
    * npm install
    * npm run start:dev

* After that go inside the **vehicle-management-frontend** folder and run following commands;
    * npm install
    * ng serve
 
* If you are getting **Postgres date/time out of range** error, run the folowing query;
 ```diff
 - ALTER DATABASE vehicle_db SET datestyle TO "ISO, MDY".
 ```
 
* After that go inside the **postgraphile-server** folder and run following commands;
    * npm install
    * npm run postgraphile
    * I have embedded the Postgraphile run commad inside **scripts : { }** tag of  **package.json** file as below since it is lengthy. Replace **username** and **password** in that command with your PostgreSQL credentails;
```diff
"scripts": {
   "postgraphile": "npx postgraphile --cors -c \"postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/vehicle_db\" --watch"
}
```
